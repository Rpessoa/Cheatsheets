# GDB CMDs #
############

Compiling: c++ -ggdb3 #will give you more information when using GDB


info: can be use with name args such as registers, threads etc
info line foo.c:42 : show PC for line 42
info line * $pc: show line begin/end for current prgram counter

tbreak: temporary breakpoint

start: will create a breakpoint at main()
list: will list the source code, if compiled using the -ggdb3 args

ctrl-x-a: will give you the source code on a screen (TUI mode)
refresh or ctrl-l: will refresh the screen
ctrl-p & ctrl-n: prev and next cmds

layout next: first time gives you src if available.
		 Next gives you assembly, next register

shell ps: shows the process id (pid)


Breakpoints and watchpoints:
watch foo: stop when foo is modified
watch -l foo: watch location
rwatch foo: stop when foo is read
watch foo thread 3: stop when thread 3 modifies foo
wtach foo if foo > 10: stop when foo is > 10

Calling inferio functions:
call foo()
print foo()
print foo+bar
print errno

Catchpoints:
Are like breakpoints but catch certain events:
catch catch: stop when C++ exceptions are caught
catch syscall 100: stop at system call number 100


Recomendations:
    Keep GDB simple - set history save on
		    - set print pretty on
		    - set pagination off
		    - set confirm off
